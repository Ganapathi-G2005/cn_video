    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 3. Fix screen frame display scaling in GUI manager

  - [x] 3.1 Update `display_screen_frame` method in ScreenShareFrame class

    - Fix aspect ratio calculation to prevent distortion
    - Remove black space by properly centering scaled images
    - Add minimum scale factor to prevent tiny images
    - Ensure canvas updates properly when receiving frames
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5_

  - [x] 3.2 Improve canvas initialization and size handling

    - Add proper canvas size detection with fallback values
    - Handle cases where canvas is not yet properly initialized
    - Add automatic rescaling when canvas size changes
    - _Requirements: 2.4, 2.5_

- [x] 4. Enhance connection manager screen sharing methods

  - [x] 4.1 Improve error reporting in presenter role request

    - Return detailed error messages instead of just boolean success
    - Add retry logic for failed presenter role requests
    - Improve logging for debugging screen sharing issues
    - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_

  - [x] 4.2 Verify screen sharing message creation and transmission

    - Test that MessageFactory creates proper screen sharing messages
    - Ensure TCP message sending works correctly for screen sharing
    - Add validation for screen sharing message format
    - _Requirements: 1.4, 5.2_

- [x] 5. Improve screen capture error handling and platform support

  - [x] 5.1 Enhance screen capture initialization with better error reporting

    - Return detailed error messages for screen capture failures
    - Add platform-specific error handling and suggestions
    - Provide fallback options when primary screen capture fails
    - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.4, 5.5_

  - [x] 5.2 Add screen capture permission and availability checks

    - Check platform capabilities before attempting screen capture
    - Provide clear error messages for permission issues
    - Add suggestions for enabling screen capture on different platforms
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 6. Fix GUI status updates and user feedback

  - [x] 6.1 Implement proper status message updates for screen sharing

    - Show "You are sharing" when local screen sharing is active
    - Display "[Username] is sharing" when receiving remote screen
    - Reset status to "Ready to share" when screen sharing stops
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

  - [x] 6.2 Add presenter role feedback and error messages

    - Display presenter role denial reasons to users
    - Show visual indicators for active screen sharing state
    - Add loading states during presenter role requests
    - _Requirements: 4.4, 4.5, 5.1_

- [x] 7. Add comprehensive error handling throughout screen sharing flow

  - [x] 7.1 Implement error handling in screen manager

    - Catch and handle screen capture initialization failures
    - Add proper cleanup when screen sharing is interrupted
    - Provide user-friendly error messages for common issues
    - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.3, 5.4_

  - [x] 7.2 Add network error handling for screen sharing

    - Handle connection failures during active screen sharing
    - Implement reconnection logic for interrupted screen sharing
    - Notify users when network issues affect screen sharing
    - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 8. Add unit tests for screen sharing components

  - Write tests for screen capture initialization and frame processing
  - Test image scaling algorithms with various aspect ratios
  - Test message serialization/deserialization for screen sharing
  - Test error handling for different failure scenarios
  - _Requirements: All requirements_

- [x] 9. Add integration tests for end-to-end screen sharing


  - Test complete screen sharing flow from button click to display
  - Test multi-client screen sharing with presenter role switching
  - Test network failure recovery during active screen sharing
  - Test platform-specific screen capture functionality
  - _Requirements: All requirements_
