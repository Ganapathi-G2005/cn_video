# Screen Sharing Fix Requirements Document

## Introduction

The screen sharing functionality in the LAN Collaboration Suite is currently not working when users click the "Start Screen Share" button. Additionally, there are display scaling issues where the shared screen area shows black space instead of properly scaled screen content. This document outlines the requirements to fix these critical issues.

## Glossary

- **Screen_Manager**: The client-side component responsible for coordinating screen capture and playback
- **Connection_Manager**: The client-side component handling network communication with the server
- **GUI_Manager**: The client-side component managing the user interface
- **Screen_Capture**: The component responsible for capturing screen content
- **Screen_Playback**: The component responsible for displaying received screen frames
- **Presenter_Role**: The exclusive role that allows a client to share their screen
- **Screen_Frame**: A compressed image representing a portion of screen content

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click the "Start Screen Share" button and have my screen sharing begin immediately, so that other participants can see my screen content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Start Screen Share" button, THE Screen_Manager SHALL request presenter role from the server
2. WHEN the server grants presenter role, THE Screen_Manager SHALL automatically start screen capture
3. WHEN screen capture starts successfully, THE GUI_Manager SHALL update the button text to "Stop Screen Share"
4. WHEN screen frames are captured, THE Screen_Capture SHALL send them to other participants via the Connection_Manager
5. IF screen capture fails to start, THEN THE Screen_Manager SHALL display an error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing a shared screen, I want to see the screen content properly scaled without black borders, so that I can clearly view the shared content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a screen frame is received, THE Screen_Playback SHALL calculate the proper aspect ratio scaling
2. WHEN displaying the screen frame, THE GUI_Manager SHALL resize the image to fit the display area while maintaining aspect ratio
3. WHEN the scaled image is smaller than the display area, THE GUI_Manager SHALL center the image without adding black borders
4. WHEN the display area changes size, THE Screen_Playback SHALL automatically rescale the current frame
5. THE Screen_Playback SHALL ensure no black space appears around properly scaled screen content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the screen sharing to work reliably across different screen resolutions and aspect ratios, so that all participants can share their screens regardless of their display setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN capturing screen content, THE Screen_Capture SHALL detect the current screen resolution
2. WHEN the screen resolution is larger than maximum dimensions, THE Screen_Capture SHALL scale down the content proportionally
3. WHEN sending screen frames, THE Screen_Capture SHALL include resolution metadata in the frame data
4. WHEN receiving screen frames, THE Screen_Playback SHALL use the resolution metadata for proper scaling
5. THE Screen_Capture SHALL support different aspect ratios without distortion

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about the screen sharing status, so that I know when my screen is being shared and when others are sharing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen sharing starts, THE GUI_Manager SHALL display "You are sharing" status message
2. WHEN another user starts sharing, THE GUI_Manager SHALL display "[Username] is sharing" status message
3. WHEN screen sharing stops, THE GUI_Manager SHALL reset the status to "Ready to share"
4. WHEN presenter role is denied, THE GUI_Manager SHALL display the denial reason to the user
5. THE GUI_Manager SHALL show visual indicators for active screen sharing state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for screen sharing failures, so that users receive helpful feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen capture initialization fails, THE Screen_Manager SHALL log the specific error and notify the user
2. WHEN network communication fails during screen sharing, THE Connection_Manager SHALL attempt to reconnect and notify the Screen_Manager
3. WHEN screen sharing is interrupted, THE Screen_Manager SHALL clean up resources and update the GUI state
4. IF platform-specific screen capture is not available, THEN THE Screen_Manager SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. THE Screen_Manager SHALL provide fallback options when primary screen capture methods fail
