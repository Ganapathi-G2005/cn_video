# Server Screen Sharing State Management Fix Requirements Document

## Introduction

The server-side screen sharing state management has a critical bug where the `active_screen_sharer` field is not properly set when screen sharing starts, causing the server to reject valid screen frames from the presenter. This results in screen sharing appearing to start but frames not being relayed to other clients.

## Glossary

- **Session_Manager**: The server-side component responsible for managing client sessions and screen sharing state
- **Network_Handler**: The server-side component that processes incoming messages and routes screen frames
- **Active_Screen_Sharer**: The client ID of the user currently sharing their screen
- **Screen_Sharing_Active**: Boolean flag indicating if screen sharing is currently active
- **Presenter_Role**: The exclusive role that allows a client to share their screen
- **Screen_Frame**: A message containing screen capture data to be relayed to other clients

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want the server to properly track which client is actively sharing their screen, so that screen frames are correctly relayed to other participants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a presenter starts screen sharing, THE Session_Manager SHALL set the active_screen_sharer to the presenter's client ID
2. WHEN screen frames are received, THE Network_Handler SHALL verify the sender matches the active_screen_sharer
3. WHEN the active screen sharer is verified, THE Network_Handler SHALL relay screen frames to all other clients
4. WHEN screen sharing stops, THE Session_Manager SHALL reset the active_screen_sharer to None
5. THE Session_Manager SHALL maintain consistent state between screen_sharing_active and active_screen_sharer

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a client user, I want my screen frames to be properly relayed when I'm the presenter, so that other participants can see my shared screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start screen sharing as the presenter, THE Session_Manager SHALL immediately set me as the active screen sharer
2. WHEN I send screen frames, THE Network_Handler SHALL accept and relay them without warnings
3. WHEN I stop screen sharing, THE Session_Manager SHALL immediately clear the active screen sharer state
4. IF another client tries to send screen frames while I'm sharing, THEN THE Network_Handler SHALL reject their frames
5. THE server SHALL log successful screen frame relay operations for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging for screen sharing state transitions, so that I can debug issues and ensure reliable operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen sharing state changes occur, THE Session_Manager SHALL log the state transitions with client IDs
2. WHEN screen frames are rejected, THE Network_Handler SHALL log the reason and expected vs actual sharer
3. WHEN a client disconnects while sharing, THE Session_Manager SHALL properly clean up the active_screen_sharer state
4. IF state inconsistencies are detected, THEN THE Session_Manager SHALL log warnings and attempt recovery
5. THE Session_Manager SHALL provide methods to query current screen sharing state for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the screen sharing state management to be thread-safe and consistent, so that concurrent operations don't corrupt the state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple threads access screen sharing state, THE Session_Manager SHALL use proper locking mechanisms
2. WHEN state changes occur, THE Session_Manager SHALL ensure atomic updates to both screen_sharing_active and active_screen_sharer
3. WHEN querying screen sharing state, THE Session_Manager SHALL return consistent snapshots of the state
4. IF concurrent start/stop operations occur, THEN THE Session_Manager SHALL handle them safely without race conditions
5. THE Session_Manager SHALL maintain state consistency even under high concurrent load
