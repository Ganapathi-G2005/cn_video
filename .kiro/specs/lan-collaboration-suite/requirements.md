# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LAN-Based Multi-User Collaboration Suite is a standalone communication and collaboration system that enables teams to interact in real-time through video, audio, chat, screen/slide sharing, and file transfer without requiring internet connectivity. The system operates on a client-server architecture over local area networks.

## Glossary

- **Collaboration_Server**: The central server application that manages user sessions, relays data streams, and coordinates all communication between clients
- **Collaboration_Client**: The client application with GUI that connects to the server and provides access to all collaboration features
- **Video_Stream**: Real-time compressed video data transmitted via UDP protocol
- **Audio_Stream**: Real-time encoded audio data transmitted via UDP protocol
- **Screen_Share**: Compressed screen capture frames transmitted via TCP protocol
- **Chat_Message**: Text-based communication transmitted via TCP protocol
- **File_Transfer**: Binary file data transmitted via TCP protocol with progress tracking
- **Session**: An active collaboration instance managed by the server with connected clients
- **Presenter**: The client currently sharing their screen or slides to other participants
- **Participant**: Any connected client in an active session

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to join a LAN-based collaboration session, so that I can communicate with my colleagues without internet dependency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user launches the Collaboration_Client, THE Collaboration_Client SHALL display connection options to join a session
2. WHEN a user provides valid server connection details, THE Collaboration_Client SHALL establish a TCP connection to the Collaboration_Server
3. WHEN the connection is successful, THE Collaboration_Server SHALL add the client to the active session
4. THE Collaboration_Server SHALL notify all existing participants of the new participant joining
5. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL display the unified dashboard with all collaboration modules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a participant, I want to engage in multi-user video conferencing, so that I can see all team members during our collaboration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a participant enables their camera, THE Collaboration_Client SHALL capture video from the webcam and compress it in real-time
2. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL transmit the Video_Stream via UDP to the Collaboration_Server
3. THE Collaboration_Server SHALL broadcast each received Video_Stream to all other connected clients
4. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL receive multiple Video_Streams and display them along with its own video feed in a dynamic grid layout
5. WHEN a participant disables their camera, THE Collaboration_Client SHALL stop transmitting video and notify other participants

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a participant, I want to engage in multi-user audio conferencing, so that I can communicate verbally with all team members simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a participant enables their microphone, THE Collaboration_Client SHALL capture audio input and encode it using a suitable codec
2. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL transmit the Audio_Stream via UDP to the Collaboration_Server
3. THE Collaboration_Server SHALL mix all incoming Audio_Streams into one composite stream
4. THE Collaboration_Server SHALL broadcast the mixed Audio_Stream back to all clients
5. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL receive and play the mixed audio stream in real-time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a presenter, I want to share my screen or slides with all participants, so that I can demonstrate content or lead presentations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a participant initiates screen sharing, THE Collaboration_Server SHALL designate them as the active Presenter
2. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL capture screen frames and compress them for transmission
3. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL transmit Screen_Share data via TCP to maintain image quality
4. THE Collaboration_Server SHALL relay screen frames to all other participants
5. WHEN the Presenter stops sharing, THE Collaboration_Server SHALL end the screen sharing session and allow others to present

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a participant, I want to send and receive text messages in a group chat, so that I can communicate through text with all team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a participant types and sends a message, THE Collaboration_Client SHALL transmit the Chat_Message via TCP to the Collaboration_Server
2. THE Collaboration_Server SHALL broadcast the Chat_Message instantly to all connected clients
3. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL display received messages in chronological order with sender information
4. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL maintain a chat history for the duration of the session
5. THE Collaboration_Server SHALL ensure reliable delivery of all Chat_Messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a participant, I want to share files with other team members, so that I can distribute documents and resources during collaboration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a participant selects a file to share, THE Collaboration_Client SHALL upload the file via TCP to the Collaboration_Server
2. THE Collaboration_Server SHALL store file metadata and notify all participants of the available file
3. WHEN a participant requests to download a file, THE Collaboration_Server SHALL transmit the File_Transfer data via TCP
4. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL display download progress with a visible progress bar
5. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL save the completed file to the participant's designated download location

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to handle multiple concurrent users efficiently, so that teams of 10-20 people can collaborate effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Collaboration_Server SHALL efficiently manage simultaneous connections from multiple Collaboration_Clients
2. THE Collaboration_Server SHALL use multithreading to handle each client connection independently
3. WHEN network latency occurs, THE Collaboration_Server SHALL maintain audio and video synchronization within acceptable limits
4. THE Collaboration_Server SHALL implement adaptive compression to optimize bandwidth usage based on network conditions
5. WHEN a client disconnects unexpectedly, THE Collaboration_Server SHALL gracefully handle the disconnection and notify remaining participants

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want a unified interface for all collaboration features, so that I can access video, audio, chat, screen sharing, and file transfer from one application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL display a unified dashboard with five distinct sections for each collaboration module
2. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL show real-time status indicators for connection, audio, and video states
3. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL display a live participant list showing all connected users
4. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL provide simple join and leave session controls
5. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL update all interface elements in real-time as session state changes

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to work on both Windows and Linux platforms, so that team members can participate regardless of their operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Collaboration_Server SHALL run on Windows 10/11 and Linux operating systems
2. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL run on Windows 10/11 and Linux operating systems
3. THE Collaboration_Server SHALL use cross-platform networking libraries for socket communication
4. THE Collaboration_Client SHALL use cross-platform GUI frameworks for consistent user experience
5. THE system SHALL handle platform-specific audio and video device access appropriately
