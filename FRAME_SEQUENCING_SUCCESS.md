## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS

### 1. Precise Timestamping System
```python
# High-precision capture timing
capture_timestamp = time.perf_counter()
relative_timestamp = capture_timestamp - capture_start_timestamp

# Enhanced packet with comprehensive timing
packet = MessageFactory.create_sequenced_video_packet(
    sender_id=client_id,
    sequence_num=sequence_number,
    video_data=compressed_frame,
    capture_timestamp=capture_timestamp,
    relative_timestamp=relative_timestamp
)
```

### 2. Chronological Ordering Algorithm
```python
# Min-heap ensures chronological order
heapq.heappush(self.frame_heap, (capture_timestamp, sequence_number))

# Retrieve frames in strict time order
while self.frame_heap:
    capture_timestamp, sequence_number = heapq.heappop(self.frame_heap)
    if self._is_frame_ready_for_display(frame):
        return frame  # Guaranteed chronological order
```

### 3. Jitter Compensation Logic
```python
# Adaptive jitter buffer
if len(self.frame_heap) < self.jitter_buffer_size:
    wait_time = current_time - oldest_frame.arrival_timestamp
    if wait_time < self.reorder_timeout:
        return None  # Wait for proper ordering

# Jitter statistics tracking
jitter = abs(inter_arrival_time - expected_interval)
self.stats['average_jitter'] = sum(self.jitter_samples) / len(self.jitter_samples)
```

### 4. Out-of-Order Frame Handling
```python
# Intelligent sequence gap handling
sequence_gap = frame.sequence_number - self.last_displayed_sequence

if sequence_gap > 1 and sequence_gap <= self.max_sequence_gap:
    if wait_time >= self.reorder_timeout:
        self.stats['sequence_gaps'] += sequence_gap - 1
        return True  # Display with documented gap
    return False  # Continue waiting for missing frames
```
